Hello!

I am new to GitHub, but excited to be here! I have a lot of experience with R and R Markdown in various settings (class, work, research, etc.) and I am a big fan of tidyverse and tidymodels.

I am currently expanding my knowledge of Python in relation to data analysis and machine learning.

Fun fact: my favorite color is green.
